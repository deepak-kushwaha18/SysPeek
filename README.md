## Description
SysPeek is an interactive, menu-based information-fetching tool made in Bash that retrieves various details from your Linux distribution — such as System, Hardware, User, and Network information — and showcases them based on your choices.
It is highly modular, with each function defined specifically for clarity and maintainability. SysPeek is lightweight, works completely offline, and is fully open-source.
